# Current Source of Truth — Foundation Family

## 2026-09-19 LIVE STATE

This file is the compact continuity record for the next maintenance chat. Current GitHub state and fresh runtime receipts override every older dated section elsewhere in the repository.

### Repository topology

- Public repository: `Z-Solo-King/foundation`
- Private repository: `Z-Solo-King/operations`
- Foundation owns public contracts/core, public Worker/API, GitHub Actions, backup/restore orchestration, and the sole canonical production release.
- Operations owns protected policy/resource governance, private execution, provider/runtime control, memory/feedback, promotion/recovery, and chatbot control.
- Operations must remain private and must contain no `.github/workflows`.
- Do not enable Cloudflare Workers Builds or Deploy Hooks as a competing deployment authority.

### Exact current revisions

- Foundation `main`: `7dc0e4164df3f20dac933f22a326e3c67fe06e59`
- Operations `main`: `f1ce7fc3957357a6da9a33f6577b4dfff606048b`
- Foundation canonical production Operations pin target: `c6f7ebaec4ebdf21cd1d036df073b90de5bc7129`
- Foundation nightly research pin remains: `f6600c068de6e17af1e0e99c1f3ba4b0f06f31b5`

### Latest canonical production receipt

- Latest verified workflow run: `35456292033` (Heroic AI production release, #232)
- Foundation revision: `6a91fbd17143083882e9ac7ebfa52f0b06a344b2`
- Last verified Operations provenance in Cloudflare: `github:f6600c068de6e17af1e0e99c1f3ba4b0f06f31b5`
- Next production certification target: `github:c6f7ebaec4ebdf21cd1d036df073b90de5bc7129`
- Cross-repository audit receipt artifact: `cross-repository-audit-receipt`

Passed in the canonical production release:

- public Worker deployment/readiness;
- private Operations deployment and exact Cloudflare provenance;
- authenticated chat;
- chat idempotency/replay;
- authenticated SSE lifecycle;
- permitted-source research ingestion/readback using `https://example.com/`;
- D1/B2 lifecycle;
- memory store/query/delete and owner boundary;
- durable task-envelope replay guard;
- candidate learning round-trip;
- rating feedback/evaluation candidate path;
- durable chat terminalization CAS;
- durable resource reservation/consume;
- durable resource reconciliation;
- maintenance scheduler reconciliation;
- provider-stream contract.

The live chat response deliberately remained `PARTIAL` with deterministic fallback because no permitted live chat provider was configured. That is an explicit governed state, not a failed production release.

### Control-plane state

- Main-push Actions control-plane probe on current Foundation `main`: SUCCESS with job creation.
- Main-push secret probe on current Foundation `main`: SUCCESS with job creation.
- Current `nightly-multi-agent-research-v2.yml` push run `35456290060`: failure before job creation; this does not satisfy the real 24-program execution gate.
- Current auxiliary nightly pin-repair, B2 backup/restore and cross-repository drift helper runs are separate automation evidence and are not production deployment authorities.
- Foundation PR #812 is merged and the v3 bridge now dispatches the allowlisted target, verifies the exact SHA, polls the target run and requires job creation. The remaining acceptance is one real execution receipt proving those conditions in the live Actions control plane.

### Current open acceptance queue

Foundation:
- #58 — this master tracker;
- #157 — real 24-program nightly execution evidence;
- #263 — real workflow-dispatch bridge receipt;
- #452 — deeper SSE cancellation/disconnect and provider-error-after-partial-output evidence.

Repository-side migration work merged today:
- Foundation #810/#811 — canonical hybrid-language pilot CI and TypeScript shadow-adapter CI.
- Foundation #812 — dispatch-capable canonical bridge v3 with exact SHA/job-creation receipt contract.
- Operations #576 — hardened TypeScript shadow search-adapter contract.
- Operations #577 — parity-gated Rust URL identity pilot.
- Operations #579 — durable failed terminalization/replay for unexpected chat execution exceptions.

Operations:
- #119 — memory persistence/restart plus live authorization/deletion evidence;
- #120 — durable feedback ingestion plus evaluation integration;
- #132 — durable replay guard across real restart/instance boundary;
- #145 — approved external scheduler activation;
- #155 — cross-repository audit receipt plus supported bridge-dispatch evidence;
- #197 — broader approved-runtime conversational execution acceptance;
- #340 — deeper provider streaming interruption/cancellation/error acceptance;
- #352 — broader extractor/mapper network replay matrix;
- #385 — broader terminalization/recovery runtime acceptance beyond the fixed attempt-identity defect.

#27 is completed and closed after the confirmed stale temporary/diagnostic/test branch cleanup. Do not reopen it merely for historical branch pruning.

There are 13 open issues total, of which 12 are non-meta acceptance gates.

### Evidence boundary

Use the ladder:

`contract -> implementation -> focused test -> CI -> control-plane -> runtime -> production`

Do not upgrade source inspection or repository tests into runtime/control-plane/production certification.

### Next-chat operating rule

Start from Foundation `7dc0e4164df3f20dac933f22a326e3c67fe06e59` and Operations `f1ce7fc3957357a6da9a33f6577b4dfff606048b`. The production receipt `35456292033` is the current L4 baseline. Work only on a missing acceptance rung or a newly established repository-side defect; do not re-open the already-correct chat/SSE/service-binding/deployment path without new evidence.
