This section supersedes older dated checkpoint values for current-state interpretation. GitHub live refs and Cloudflare runtime receipts are authoritative.

- Foundation main at this audit snapshot: 01bfa0c6a74bf6f10082ac8034aa1b2d098d0e42.
- Operations main at this audit snapshot: 207d8a3f081f58702b56fe64c57fe2c3042ce75d.

- Production release 36115559861 failed at Cloudflare API error 6111 (invalid Authorization header format during zone lookup). Current-head production is not certified.
- Nightly preflight 36115559932 failed with public Worker HTTP 000; nightly 36115573281 was cancelled by the exact production gate. No new provider-backed 24-program receipt exists.
- Live extractor benchmark 36115560009 passed: 40 receipts, provenance 1.0, route provenance 1.0, repeat reliability 1.0, 0 unstable groups, 4 ok / 32 empty / 4 blocked. Artifact 10855326519; digest sha256:1890da70d49377f2f89ee11daa644882a90972666916c07e7aa4edc8066c449e.
- Cloudflare: account role Super Administrator - All Privileges; heroic-ai.dev pending with activation failure reason unresolvable; custom domain enabled on foundation; deployed Foundation provenance github:a1da7d115c69b9f9df21bd2c6d60dd2b717f232c; deployed Operations provenance github:a3171f353539f1a31020c432f98cf0530cbf91ef; D1 research-intelligence ID 19f51638-47a5-4218-a9dc-73dbfd6156fe.
- Current Foundation main family-integrity workflow already uses actions/create-github-app-token and current main no longer contains the closed operations#352 target.
- ChatGPT/UI state is transport state only. Use this override as the cross-chat continuation point and refresh live refs before mutation.
